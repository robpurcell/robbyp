I've left it nearly to the last minute, but I can now say that I wrote a blog in the Noughties.  I can't promise that it will be Earth shattering, but the Earth needs all the help it can get these days.  


I also think it's unlikely that this will be remotely amusing (see previous quip) but hopefully it will be informative.  If nothing else, it's going to be a spot for me to keep track of a bunch of random thoughts, maybe ideas and certainly links to interesting stuff.
