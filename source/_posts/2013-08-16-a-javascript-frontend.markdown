[Previously](/blog/2013/04/16/notes-for-a-prospective-web-developer/) I have toyed with Grunt for the Javascript and CSS workflow.  To keep things moving on, I'm going to try out [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) which is based on Grunt.

Following the getting started instructions on the homepage.  As I already have the prerequistes installed, I'm jumping right in:

    npm install -g yo
    npm install -g generator-webapp
    npm install -g generator-angular

Wow, a lot of things are downloaded.

It's at this stage that I've realised that I've opened Pandora's box, and really there's too much stuff going on here to fully appreciate how it all fits together.  So I propose (to myself) that I try out a more bespoke [approach](/blog/2013/08/16/aangularjs) and work towards using the full toolkit at a later stage.
