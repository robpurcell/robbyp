Having drawn a breath, and taken a holiday, I now feel like getting back into learning more about AngularJS and how best to structure the application that I've had in mind for ages.

I found [this](http://bit.ly/15kYjfx) nice article that gives a sensible approach for laying out the app.  While searching here, I found another interesting [link](https://github.com/joshdmiller/ng-boilerplate) which gives a very nice looking boilerplate layout for AngularJS without all the additional complexity (to me, at the moment) of the Yeoman approach.

I'm following the tutorial in the [MEAP](http://www.manning.com/about/meap) of [AngularJS in Action](http://www.manning.com/bford/), and storing the code as I go in [Git](https://github.com/robpurcell/angina).
